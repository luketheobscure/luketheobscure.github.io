I started out as an artist and designer, but I wasn’t great at it. I was much better at programming, so I’ve been doing that for the past 20 or so years. I could fill this paragraph with keywords, but I won’t. Instead I’ll just say that over the last two decades I’ve done just about every aspect of software development.

These days my expertise is mostly in web development. I’m an expert in TypeScript, but I’ve a fondness for Swift, Rust and now Kotlin. I enjoy bringing structure to large, complex projects.

I like making music, reading books, and I still paint from time to time. I have four children, and they are my world.
