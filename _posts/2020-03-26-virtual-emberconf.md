It was such an honor to be chosen as a speaker at EmberConf 2020. While I was disappointed that we had to go virtual, I was absolutely impressed by how well the organizers adapted. Getting to watch my talk live with thousands of other people and seeing their feedback in real-time was an experience I will cherish.
